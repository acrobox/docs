# Acrobox

## What is Acrobox?

Acrobox provides tools and workflows for solo developers to rapidly build,
deploy, observe, and iterate on a secure, affordable, and low maintenance
platform --- a Platform as a Service (PaaS) for indie hackers.

Acrobox provisions infrastructure with minimal footprint on your DigitalOcean
account complete with SSH keys, a network layer firewall, and independently
scalable block storage. Automatic updates are configured out of the box.

The `abx` command line program is used to manage containerized sites, services,
and tasks. Sites are exposed through a reverse proxy that issues automatic
SSL/TLS certificates. View system resources, recent deploys, and application
logs with the same tool.

## Who is Acrobox for?

Acrobox alleviates operational complexities and lays the foundation for solo
indie hackers to build and support multiple small businesses. Whether you're
building a bootstrapped startup, grinding on side hustles, or hosting personal
projects, Acrobox provides structure for building maintainable applications
today without locking you in tomorrow.

Software development is complex on its own. Now you want to show the world what
you've built. Stakeholder pressure, life obligations, family commitments ---
you just want to focus on your craft. Many solutions to this problem exist.
Acrobox aims to strike a new balance between affordability, simplicity, and
openness.

Acrobox is for those that value quality but are not quite ready to invest the
time and resources into individual products and solutions for the myriad of
technical challenges involved in deploying and maintaining multiple secure and
observable production applications. Acrobox can help you get there.
