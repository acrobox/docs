# Legal

*January 28, 2022*

I use a lot of broad language to limit liability. I built this service as a
solo indie hacker primarily for other solo indie hackers. I ask for respect
towards myself and the services I have built and I promise to do my best to
treat you the same in return.

If you have any questions, please reach out to hello@acrobox.io.

### Account

1. A human must create and operate your account.
2. You must provide a valid email address. Your email address is used for
   contact and registration with Let's Encrypt to be notified about problems
   with issued certificates. Your email address will not otherwise be shared.
3. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account,
   password, and access token.
4. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account,
   including but not limited to machines initialized by others who have
   access to your account.

### Payments and Refunds

1. By initializing a new machine, you authorize Acrobox to send instructions to
   the financial institution that issued your card take monthly payments from
   your card account in accordance with your plan and available discounts.
  - You will receive a one time $10 USD discount if you signed up using a
    valid referral link from an existing customer.
  - You will receive a monthly $1 USD discount for every customer that signed
    up using your referral link and has one or more active subscriptions older
    than 7 days at the time of invoicing.
2. Acrobox is not responsible for any additional fees charged to your card
   account by third party providers. The machine defaults will cost you an
   additional $6.10 USD per month payable to DigitalOcean.
3. Service cancellations made within 7 days of the invoice date will be
   automatically refunded and service will be disabled immediately. Service
   cancellations made thereafter will maintain service until the end of the
   billing period without a refund.
4. If the pricing structure is to change, you will receive advanced notice.

### Past Due and Suspended Accounts

1. You will be notified by email if a monthly subscription payment fails.
   There are many reasons for failed payments. Unless a reason is provided, you
   are recommended to contact your bank for further details.
2. You will be unable to initialize new machines while a payment is past due
   but your existing service will continue to operate for up to 7 days.
3. If a subscription remains past due beyond the 7 day grace period, your
   Acrobox service will be suspended and you will be notified by email.
4. You may renew your subscription with `abx renew` after providing a valid
   payment method on the Acrobox account dashboard.

### Cancellation and Termination

1. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your subscription.
2. I have the right to suspend or terminate your account or subscription for
   any reason at any time.
3. You have the right to receive an explanation, and advance warning when
   possible, if your account or subscription is to be suspended or terminated.

### Service

1. I may modify, add, or remove any or all parts of the service.
2. If the service ceases operation, you will receive advanced notice.

### Backups

2. I have no liability for any data that may be lost.
