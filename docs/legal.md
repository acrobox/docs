# Legal

*November 6, 2021*

I use a lot of broad language to limit liability. I built this service as a
solo indie hacker primarily for other solo indie hackers. I ask for respect
towards myself and the services I have built and I promise to do my best to
treat you the same in return.

If you have any questions, please reach out to hello@acrobox.io.
